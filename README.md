### Hi to myself in the future
In early November 2021, you did your final exam in Bachelor's of Biomedical Science and graduate with "Distinction". 
You were happy and proud back then because you were not believe that you made a thesis relating to lung cancer, online of course.

After you graduation, you were confused and keept asking to yourself 'what do I want to do in the future?' since COVID-19 pandemic caused you to loose technical/laboratory
experience opportunities which made you stressed and depressed. So, you contacted to your college career advisor and he suggested you to take graduate study. However, you were
uncertain about the current COVID-19 pandemic.

On early December 2021, you keep learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you wanted to become a 'Front-End Web Developer' on 'FreeCodeCamp'

On 22 January 2022, you created your GitHub account


I hope to myself success and make your family in Indonesia proud
